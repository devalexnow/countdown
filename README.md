# **Countdown**
### made in JavaScript

## **About the project**

The project:
1. Is **mobile responsive**
2. Store the countdown in **a local storage**
3. Has **video background**
4. Has **text animation** when the countdown is finished
 
## **How it works**

On the splash page, you can enter a title for something you want to count down to. There is an input date element where you can either type in the date or use a handy **date picker.**

The cool thing about this project is that it **stores the countdown information in local storage.** So it allows you to refresh the page, or you can come back to the page another day and the countdown will still be running.

Of course, you also have the option to reset the countdown.
When the countdown is over, it **shows „Countdown Complete!" text animation**, the title of the countdown, and the date that it finished. There is also a button „New countdown".

This mechanism **can be implemented,** for example, in an online advertisement to count down to the end of the offer.
